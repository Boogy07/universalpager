Universal Pager

![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/Boogy07/universalpager.svg?branch=master)

A PHP based multi page navigation widget.

This is a simple set of PHP and css codes to add a pager widget to your site. 
Once activated and a pager link is clicked, it will move the user to the next page in the sequence.

The new page will have a new modifier in the url - get parameters ?page=(num), where num is the page number to load.

To install simply include the PHP file into each page it's needed, or add to your class/method system, and intiate by calling uniPager()

Add the css lines to your stylesheet. Some additional styling may be required to perfect layout.
